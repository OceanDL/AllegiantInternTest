Allegiant Intern Interview Coding Test

This GitHub repo consists of a basic HTML page for seeing JS console output and the completed JS test file. Since the TODO sections did not include the incrementDepartmentCount I did not include an additional console output function for it, however the function builds out a key value pair of personal count with each associated department to populate the given departmentsCount object.
